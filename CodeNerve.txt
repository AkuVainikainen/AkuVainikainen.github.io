Hey there!

My name is Aku, and I'm a 19-year-old game developer and 3D artist from Finland.
I have a strong passion for a lot of things - game design, coding, 3D modeling, and graphic design, to name a few.
My skills vary; I have extensive experience in Unity and Blender with some knowledge in a lot of other software. I also have plans to learn unreal engine.
I'm currently studying game development and 3D art at Media Center Lybecker<br/><br/>
